<strong>Changes</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Added get and set Hunger commands as part of the Player API</li>
	<li>Added playerapi.getPlayerLook() which returns a vector containing the point the player is looking at, If that point is invalid (off the world) then it returns the player's current position.</li>
	<li>Added playerapi.tpv(Vector3f vec) which is a version of tp which takes a vector</li>
	<li>Added JS Stick. You can now run /jss js-string to put a stick in your inventory which runs js-string on right click. A good example of this is /jss me().tpv(me().getPlayerLook().add(0, 2, 0)) Which makes a blinking spell.</li>
</ul>
