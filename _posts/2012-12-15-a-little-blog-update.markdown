Well this is worth starting off by saying there's a new theme on this blog. It's TwentyTwelve and it comes with the latest version of Wordpress. Aside from that I killed off most my old customization. I like this new theme, Very clean.

Now onto a bit of a rant. I recently got a x86 Windows 8 Tablet. One that is quite capable as a normal computer. It can run Eclipse, Minecraft, real Google Chrome, Spotify and many other useful things. Naturally I decided to play some games on it. I got a whole day sucked away by one called Jetpack Joyride but then I went to try some indie games normally ment for a mouse and keyboard. Dungeons of Dredmor works fine but only in windowed mode and you often have to tap twice on something. Dustforce does not work but I never expected it to. Minecraft of all things works and at a "playable" FPS if your on superflat.

Though that was not a rant, that was giving my tablet some prase (There are some really annoying hardware issues right now but anyway)...

I was about to rant about how the input should be working but does not. I blame no one for that and it's something that will improve over time so why rant about people not jumping on new stuff.

On to more "on-topic" stuff (this blog so far has had most posts relate to MinecraftScript and that will not stop). I've still been working on MinecraftScript but I've got quite a major update coming that I would like to get stable first time. I'm improving the web server, hardening it and making it more flexible. The reason for this comes back to something that I've been planing since I started this mod. I never intended to have people run JavaScript with a in-game command, it was more something that ended up being so easy and useful it's become a bit of a focus. The API is now a lot more concise and simple as a result. I orginaly intending it to be a in between layer to make writing mods really easy. And to continue with that the next update is geting a web browser based script editor. The idea is you write and edit more complex scripting outside of the game (say on a tablet) which is then run by the server. This will be very secure right from the get go I can asure you.

Well that was a long blog post. This is often how I used to post to blogs and to a extent is how I prefer to. But with one addition.
<h2><strong>TLDR</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">New Theme, it's cool.</span></li>
	<li>Windows 8 tablets are cool.</li>
	<li>I'm added a web based script editor to MinecraftScript.</li>
</ul>
