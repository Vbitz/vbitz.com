Yes there is. Minecraft does have a really useful ingame editor that allows you to send text to other players. It's called a Written Book and it's really handy since it supports many pages and a large amount of content compared to simple chat commands.

With the new /jsdobook command in MinecraftScript you can take the content of one of these books and run it as JavaScript.
